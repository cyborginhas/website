For the CS 593 Robotics course and research at [MARS Lab](), I am developing a self-supervised rope manipulation robot system in MuJoCo with a Panda robot arm. This project utilizes the following components:
- Causal InfoGAN framework[^1] for planning from pixel observations
- Inverse Dynamics[^2] model mapping pixels to high-level actions
- PID/MPC-CEM for generating and executing joint-space trajectories from high-level actions

### Kinematic Planning/Control

Given start and goal poses in task-space, simple linear interpolation is used to plan discretized XYZ waypoints from start to goal. Then inverse kinematics is used to generate joint-space trajectories.
